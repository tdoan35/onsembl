# Onsembl.ai Implementation Audit

## Overview
This audit documents the current implementation status of the Onsembl.ai Agent Control Center as of the completion of specs/001-build-onsembl-ai/tasks.md.

## ✅ What's Implemented

### Backend (Port 3001)
- **Core Server**: Fastify server running with WebSocket support
- **WebSocket Handlers**:
  - Agent handler (agent-handler.ts)
  - Dashboard handler (dashboard-handler.ts)
- **Services**: Agent service, Command service, Audit service, Auth service
- **Models**: All 9 data models defined
- **Middleware**: CORS, auth, error handling, rate limiting, request ID, logging
- **Database**: Supabase integration configured

### Frontend (Port 3000)
- **UI Components**:
  - Dashboard with tabs (Overview, Agents, Terminal, Traces)
  - Agent cards and status displays
  - Command input component
  - Terminal viewer component
  - Emergency stop button
  - Trace tree component
  - Command queue display
  - Audit log viewer
  - Presets management
  - Reports viewer
- **State Management**: Zustand stores for agents, commands, UI state
- **Services**: WebSocket service, API service, Auth service (all created but not connected)

### Agent Wrapper
- **Mock Agent**: Working simulation agent for testing
- **CLI Structure**: Command-line interface with start/stop/status commands
- **WebSocket Client**: Can connect to backend
- **Stream Capture**: Terminal output handling

### Shared Packages
- **agent-protocol**: WebSocket message types and validation
- **command-queue**: BullMQ queue management structure
- **trace-collector**: LLM trace aggregation structure

## ❌ What's NOT Implemented/Connected

### Critical Missing Connections

1. **Frontend ↔ Backend WebSocket Connection**
   - WebSocket service exists but not initialized in dashboard
   - No connection established from frontend to backend
   - Agent status updates not flowing to frontend store
   - Command execution not wired up
   - Terminal output not streaming to UI

2. **Backend ↔ Database**
   - Supabase client configured but not used
   - No actual data persistence happening
   - Models defined but not saving/retrieving data

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Auth middleware exists but not enforcing
   - No login flow implemented
   - JWT token generation/validation incomplete

### Unimplemented Features

1. **Agent Management**
   - Real Claude/Gemini/Codex agent implementations (only mock works)
   - Agent process lifecycle management
   - Agent health monitoring
   - Automatic agent restart on failure

2. **Command Execution**
   - Command queue processing with BullMQ
   - Priority-based execution
   - Command interruption/cancellation
   - Command timeout handling

3. **Data Persistence**
   - Agent status persistence
   - Command history storage
   - Audit log recording
   - Terminal output archival
   - Trace data storage

4. **Real-time Features**
   - Live terminal streaming
   - Agent status broadcasts
   - Command progress updates
   - Trace tree updates

5. **Advanced Features**
   - Command presets CRUD operations
   - Investigation reports generation
   - Execution constraints enforcement
   - 30-day audit log retention
   - Token rotation mechanism

### Missing Integrations

1. **Redis/BullMQ**
   - Queue not connected to Redis
   - Job processing not implemented
   - Priority queue logic missing

2. **Supabase Realtime**
   - Realtime subscriptions not set up
   - State synchronization not working

3. **External AI Services**
   - No actual Claude API integration
   - No Gemini API integration
   - No OpenAI Codex integration

## 🔧 What Needs Immediate Attention

### To Get Basic Functionality Working:

1. **Initialize WebSocket in Frontend**
   ```typescript
   // In dashboard page useEffect
   - Connect to ws://localhost:3001/ws/dashboard
   - Subscribe to agent updates
   - Update store when agents connect/disconnect
   ```

2. **Wire Agent Updates to Frontend**
   ```typescript
   // In backend agent-handler
   - Broadcast agent status to all dashboard connections
   - Send agent list on dashboard connection
   ```

3. **Enable Command Execution Flow**
   ```typescript
   // Frontend → Backend → Agent → Backend → Frontend
   - Send command from UI
   - Route through backend to correct agent
   - Execute and stream output back
   ```

4. **Connect to Database**
   ```typescript
   // In services
   - Save agent connections
   - Store command history
   - Record audit logs
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps Priority

1. **Connect Frontend WebSocket** (2-3 hours)
   - Initialize service in dashboard
   - Handle agent status messages
   - Update Zustand stores

2. **Complete Agent-Dashboard Communication** (3-4 hours)
   - Broadcast agent updates
   - Route commands properly
   - Stream terminal output

3. **Basic Database Integration** (2-3 hours)
   - Save agent connections
   - Store command history
   - Enable audit logging

4. **Command Execution Pipeline** (4-5 hours)
   - Wire up command submission
   - Implement queue processing
   - Add output streaming

5. **Authentication Flow** (3-4 hours)
   - Add login page
   - Implement JWT validation
   - Secure WebSocket connections

## Summary

The project has a solid foundation with all UI components built and backend structure in place. However, the critical connections between layers are missing:
- Frontend ↔ Backend WebSocket connection not established
- Backend ↔ Database operations not implemented
- Agent ↔ Backend command flow incomplete

The application appears functional in the UI but lacks the actual data flow and persistence layers needed for real operation. The mock agent proves the concept works, but substantial integration work remains to make it a functioning system.

Estimated time to MVP with basic functionality: **15-20 hours** of focused development.
