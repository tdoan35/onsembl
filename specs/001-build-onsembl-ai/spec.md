## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ÔøΩ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ÔøΩ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ÔøΩ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ÔøΩ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ÔøΩ Each requirement must be testable
   ÔøΩ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ÔøΩ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ÔøΩ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a software engineer, I want to control and monitor multiple AI coding agents from a single dashboard so that I can orchestrate complex development tasks efficiently while maintaining visibility into each agent's activities and resource usage.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** multiple AI agents are installed locally, **When** a user launches Onsembl, **Then** the dashboard displays status cards for Claude, Gemini, and Codex agents showing online/offline status
2. **Given** agents are online, **When** a user sends a command through the input area, **Then** the command is executed by the selected agent(s) and output appears in the central terminal area
3. **Given** multiple agents are processing commands, **When** viewing the terminal output, **Then** each agent's output is color-coded and clearly identified
4. **Given** an agent is actively processing, **When** a user clicks emergency stop, **Then** the agent immediately halts execution
5. **Given** command presets are saved, **When** a user selects a preset, **Then** the command is populated and ready to send to agents
6. **Given** agents have been running, **When** viewing the trace tree, **Then** all LLM prompts and tool calls are displayed hierarchically
7. **Given** an agent is busy processing a command, **When** a user sends another command, **Then** the new command is queued and user can see queue status
8. **Given** an agent is executing a command, **When** a user sends an interrupt signal, **Then** the current command is cancelled and agent becomes available

### Edge Cases

- What happens when an agent disconnects unexpectedly during command execution?
- How does system handle when token budget is exceeded mid-execution?
- What happens when time limit is reached during agent processing?
- What happens when attempting to send commands to offline agents?
- How does system handle agent reconnection after network failure?
- What happens when multiple commands are queued and user wants to reorder them?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display real-time connection status for Claude, Gemini, and Codex agents
- **FR-002**: System MUST stream terminal output from each connected agent in real-time
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to send commands to individual agents or broadcast to all
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide color-coded terminal output for each agent
- **FR-005**: System MUST track and display agent health metrics and current activity status
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a hierarchical trace view of all LLM prompts and tool calls
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to save and reuse command presets
- **FR-008**: System MUST enforce configurable time limits for agent execution
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce token budget constraints for agent operations
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide emergency stop functionality for all agents
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to filter terminal view by specific agents
- **FR-012**: System MUST support search through historical command logs
- **FR-013**: System MUST persist all commands and outputs for audit purposes
- **FR-014**: Users MUST be able to stop and restart individual agents
- **FR-015**: System MUST display agent processing vs idle states clearly
- **FR-016**: System MUST support natural language commands and structured verbs (Investigate, Review, Plan, Synthesize)
- **FR-017**: System MUST display and store investigation reports generated by agents
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle at least 10 concurrent agent connections
- **FR-019**: System MUST retain audit logs for 30 days minimum
- **FR-020**: System MUST authenticate users via Supabase magic link authentication (email-based)
- **FR-021**: System operates as single-tenant where all authenticated users can control all connected agents
- **FR-022**: Agents MUST automatically connect to configured server URL on launch without manual pairing
- **FR-023**: System MUST queue commands for busy agents with ability to interrupt/cancel executing commands
- **FR-024**: Investigation reports MUST be stored as structured data in database with export functionality
- **FR-025**: System MUST implement smart reconnection logic for agents (infinite retry for network issues, limited retry for configuration issues)

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Agent**: Represents an AI coding assistant (Claude, Gemini, or Codex) with status, health metrics, and activity state
- **Command**: User input sent to one or more agents, including natural language or structured verbs
- **Terminal Output**: Timestamped, agent-identified output from command execution
- **Command Preset**: Saved command template for reuse across sessions
- **Trace Entry**: Hierarchical record of LLM prompts and tool calls made by agents
- **Investigation Report**: Structured document stored as database records with metadata for searching
- **Audit Log**: Persistent record of all commands, outputs, and system events with 30-day retention
- **Execution Constraint**: Time limits and token budgets applied to agent operations
- **Command Queue**: Ordered list of pending commands for each agent with interrupt capability
