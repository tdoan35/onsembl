## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:
1. âœ… All checklist items are verified
2. âœ… Tests are written and passing
3. âœ… Code is committed with descriptive message
4. âœ… Documentation is updated if needed
5. âœ… No linting or type errors
6. âœ… Follows patterns from implementation-patterns.md

## Red Flags - Stop if you see these:

- ðŸš¨ Test passes on first run (should fail in RED phase)
- ðŸš¨ Hardcoded values that should be configurable
- ðŸš¨ Missing error handling
- ðŸš¨ Console.log instead of proper logging
- ðŸš¨ Any TypeScript `any` without justification
- ðŸš¨ Direct database queries instead of using models
- ðŸš¨ Synchronous operations that should be async
- ðŸš¨ Missing authentication on protected endpoints
- ðŸš¨ Secrets in code or configs

## Quick Validation Commands

```bash
# Check if tests fail (RED phase)
npm test -- --testNamePattern="should return 200"

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Check test coverage
npm test -- --coverage

# Validate database migrations
npx supabase migration validate

# Check for security issues
npm audit
```
