# Feature Specification: Fix WebSocket Authentication Security Vulnerability

**Feature Branch**: `005-fix-websocket-authentication`
**Created**: 2025-09-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix WebSocket Authentication Security Vulnerability (ONS-6)"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Security vulnerability identified: WebSocket connections lack authentication
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: agents, dashboards, authenticated users, malicious clients
   ’ Actions: connect, authenticate, validate tokens, enforce access control
   ’ Data: JWT tokens, user context, connection metadata
   ’ Constraints: <200ms latency, backward compatibility, role-based access
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ No ambiguities in security requirements
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Clear security scenarios defined
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement is testable and security-focused
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Connection contexts, user sessions, rate limit trackers
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All security requirements clearly specified
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system administrator, I need all WebSocket connections to be authenticated and authorized so that only legitimate users can access the agent control system and sensitive command data is protected from unauthorized access.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a client with a valid JWT token, **When** they attempt to connect to the WebSocket endpoint, **Then** the connection is accepted and user context is attached
2. **Given** a client without a JWT token, **When** they attempt to connect to the WebSocket endpoint, **Then** the connection is rejected with appropriate error code
3. **Given** a client with an expired JWT token, **When** they attempt to connect to the WebSocket endpoint, **Then** the connection is rejected with authentication error
4. **Given** an agent with a dashboard token, **When** they attempt to connect to the agent endpoint, **Then** the connection is rejected for role mismatch
5. **Given** a user with 10 active connections, **When** they attempt an 11th connection, **Then** the connection is rejected with rate limit error
6. **Given** an active connection with expiring token, **When** a refresh token is provided, **Then** the connection remains active with updated credentials

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a token expires during an active connection?
- How does system handle malformed JWT tokens?
- What occurs when rate limit is reached mid-session?
- How are connection attempts from banned IPs handled?
- What happens during token refresh if the refresh token is invalid?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate JWT tokens before accepting any WebSocket connection
- **FR-002**: System MUST reject connections without valid authentication with appropriate error codes
- **FR-003**: System MUST attach authenticated user information to each WebSocket connection context
- **FR-004**: System MUST enforce role-based access control (agents can only connect to agent endpoints, dashboards to dashboard endpoints)
- **FR-005**: System MUST prevent any single user from establishing more than 10 concurrent connections
- **FR-006**: System MUST support in-band token refresh without disconnecting active sessions
- **FR-007**: System MUST log all authentication failures with relevant security context
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain connection authentication state throughout the session lifecycle
- **FR-009**: System MUST reject connections with expired tokens immediately
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages for different authentication failure types
- **FR-011**: System MUST track and enforce per-user rate limits for connection attempts
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate token signatures using secure cryptographic methods

### Key Entities
- **Authenticated Connection**: Represents a WebSocket connection with verified user credentials, containing user ID, roles, connection timestamp, and authentication status
- **User Session**: Tracks active connections per user, enforcing connection limits and managing rate limiting counters
- **Authentication Context**: Contains JWT claims, user permissions, token expiry, and refresh token information for each connection
- **Rate Limit Tracker**: Monitors connection attempts per user/IP, enforcing limits and tracking violation attempts
