# Feature Specification: Integrate Supabase Authentication

**Feature Branch**: `006-integrate-supabase-authentication`
**Created**: 2025-09-22
**Status**: Ready for Implementation
**Input**: User description: "Integrate Supabase authentication into the Onsembl.ai Agent Control Center application"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Supabase authentication integration identified
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: Users (agents/operators)
   � Actions: Sign up, sign in, sign out, session management
   � Data: User credentials, sessions, user profiles
   � Constraints: Security, session persistence, data isolation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Social auth providers marked as future enhancement
   � User roles/permissions deferred to later phase
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Authentication flows defined
   � Session management scenarios included
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � All requirements are testable
   � Focus on user-facing capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities
   � User, Session, Protected Resources
7. Run Review Checklist
   � No implementation details included
   � All requirements testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As an operator of AI agents, I need to create a personal account and securely log in to the Onsembl.ai dashboard so that I can manage my own agents and view only my data, ensuring privacy and security of my operations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### OAuth Sign-in/Sign-up
1. **Given** a user on the login modal, **When** they click "Sign in with Google", **Then** they are redirected to Google OAuth, authenticated, and logged into the dashboard (creating an account if new)
2. **Given** a user on the login modal, **When** they click "Sign in with GitHub", **Then** they are redirected to GitHub OAuth, authenticated, and logged into the dashboard (creating an account if new)

#### Email/Password Authentication
3. **Given** a new user on the login modal, **When** they switch to "Sign up" tab and enter email, password, and optional username, **Then** an account is created and they are logged into the dashboard
4. **Given** an existing user on the login modal, **When** they enter email and password in "Log in" tab and submit, **Then** they are authenticated and see their dashboard
5. **Given** a user entering invalid credentials, **When** they attempt to sign in, **Then** they see a clear error message

#### Password Reset
6. **Given** a user who forgot their password, **When** they click "Forgot your password?" link, **Then** they can enter their email to receive a password reset link
7. **Given** a user who requested password reset, **When** they receive the email and click the reset link, **Then** they can set a new password and log in

#### Session Management
8. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they click "Sign Out", **Then** their session ends and they return to the login page
9. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they refresh the page or close and reopen the browser, **Then** they remain logged in
10. **Given** an unauthenticated user, **When** they try to access the dashboard, **Then** they are redirected to the login page

#### Data Isolation
11. **Given** a logged-in user, **When** they view agents or commands, **Then** they see only their own data
12. **Given** two different logged-in users, **When** each accesses their dashboard, **Then** they see completely isolated data sets

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user enters an already registered email during sign up? � Display "Email already in use" error
- How does system handle network disconnection during login? � Show connection error and allow retry
- What happens when a session expires? � Redirect to login with "Session expired" message
- How does the system handle simultaneous logins from multiple devices? � All sessions remain valid
- What happens if user forgets password? → User clicks "Forgot your password?" link, enters email, receives reset link via email
- What if OAuth provider is unavailable? → Show error message and suggest using email/password method
- What if password reset email doesn't arrive? → Provide "Resend email" option after 60 seconds
- What if user tries to use expired password reset link? → Display "Link expired" message and prompt to request new reset

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### OAuth Authentication
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to sign in or sign up using Google OAuth
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to sign in or sign up using GitHub OAuth
- **FR-003**: System MUST create new user accounts automatically when OAuth users sign in for the first time

#### Email/Password Authentication
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow new users to create accounts using email address, password, and optional username
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that email addresses are properly formatted and unique
- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users with email and password credentials

#### Password Reset
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a "Forgot your password?" link on the login modal
- **FR-008**: System MUST send password reset emails containing secure reset links to verified email addresses
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to set a new password using a valid reset link
- **FR-010**: System MUST expire password reset links after a reasonable time period

#### Session Management
- **FR-011**: System MUST maintain user sessions across page refreshes and browser restarts
- **FR-012**: System MUST automatically redirect unauthenticated users to the login page when accessing protected areas
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow authenticated users to sign out, ending their session
- **FR-014**: System MUST display the logged-in user's email address or username in the application interface
- **FR-015**: Users MUST be able to remain logged in across multiple browser tabs/windows
- **FR-016**: System MUST handle session expiration gracefully with user notification

#### Data Isolation & Security
- **FR-017**: System MUST isolate each user's data so users can only view and manage their own agents, commands, and settings
- **FR-018**: System MUST display appropriate error messages for authentication failures (invalid credentials, network errors, etc.)
- **FR-019**: System MUST secure all real-time WebSocket connections to require authentication
- **FR-020**: System MUST terminate WebSocket connections when a user signs out
- **FR-021**: System MUST enforce minimum password requirements (at least 6 characters as per Supabase default)
- **FR-022**: System MUST log authentication events for security auditing

### Key Entities
- **User**: Represents an authenticated operator with email, unique identifier, and creation timestamp
- **Session**: Represents an active authentication state with expiration and refresh capabilities
- **Protected Resource**: Any data or functionality that requires authentication (agents, commands, settings, terminal outputs)
- **Authentication Event**: Security audit record of login attempts, logouts, and session changes

## Review & Acceptance Checklist

### Content Quality
- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

### Requirement Completeness
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

### Clarifications Resolved
1. **Password Reset**: ✅ Users can reset passwords via "Forgot your password?" link, which sends a secure reset link to their email
2. **Password Requirements**: ✅ Using Supabase default minimum of 6 characters (can be enhanced later if needed)
