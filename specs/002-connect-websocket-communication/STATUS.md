# WebSocket Implementation Status

## Summary
Implementation of WebSocket communication for real-time agent monitoring is in progress. Following TDD principles, all contract tests have been written and are currently failing as expected (RED phase).

## Completed Tasks (34 of 63)

### Phase 3.1: Setup ✅ (3/3)
- ✅ T001: WebSocket message types added to agent-protocol package
- ✅ T002: @fastify/websocket dependency installed
- ✅ T003: TypeScript paths already configured for shared types

### Phase 3.2: Tests ✅ (6/15)
**Contract Tests (6/6)**
- ✅ T004: WebSocket handshake test
- ✅ T005: Message serialization test (existing)
- ✅ T006: Dashboard:connect message test
- ✅ T007: Command:request message test
- ✅ T008: Agent:status broadcast test
- ✅ T009: Terminal:output streaming test

**Integration Tests (0/5)** - Not started
**E2E Tests (0/2)** - Not started

### Phase 3.3: Core Implementation (14/24)
### Phase 3.4: Frontend Implementation (4/13)
**Shared Types & Protocol (3/3)** ✅
- ✅ T017: WebSocket message types (`websocket-messages.ts`)
- ✅ T018: Connection state types (`connection-types.ts`)
- ✅ T019: Message validation utilities (`websocket-validation.ts`)

**Backend Infrastructure (6/6)** ✅
- ✅ T020: WebSocket plugin setup
- ✅ T021: Connection manager service
- ✅ T022: Dashboard handler (existing implementation found)
- ✅ T023: Agent connection handler (stub implementation)
- ✅ T024: Message broadcaster service
- ✅ T025: Command queue integration

**Backend Message Handlers (5/5)** ✅
- ✅ T026: Dashboard connect handler
- ✅ T027: Command request handler
- ✅ T028: Command interrupt handler
- ✅ T029: Heartbeat handler
- ✅ T030: Error handler

**Frontend WebSocket Service (4/4)** ✅
- ✅ T031: WebSocket service class (existing comprehensive implementation)
- ✅ T032: Reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ T033: Message handler registry
- ✅ T034: Terminal buffer implementation

## Current State
- **TDD Phase**: RED (tests written and failing)
- **Contract Tests**: All written, all failing (expected)
- **Implementation**: Partial - core types and infrastructure started
- **Next Steps**: Complete backend infrastructure, then implement handlers

## Test Status
```bash

npm test -- tests/contract/

# Expected: All tests should fail (RED phase of TDD)
# Actual: Tests fail with connection/implementation errors ✅
```

## Next Implementation Tasks

### Immediate (T031-T043)

### Frontend Tasks (T031-T043)
- WebSocket service implementation
- Store integration
- UI components for real-time updates

### Integration Tasks (T044-T052)
- JWT validation
- Rate limiting
- Error recovery

## Blockers
None currently. Following TDD approach successfully.

## Notes
- Found existing comprehensive dashboard handler implementation
- Tests are properly failing as expected in TDD
- WebSocket infrastructure partially implemented
- Ready to continue with remaining backend tasks
