# Feature Specification: Connect WebSocket Communication for Real-time Agent Monitoring

**Feature Branch**: `002-connect-websocket-communication`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Connect WebSocket communication between frontend dashboard and backend server to enable real-time agent monitoring and command execution. The frontend (Next.js on port 3000) needs to initialize its WebSocket service to connect to the backend (Fastify on port 3001) dashboard endpoint. When agents connect to the backend, their status updates should broadcast to all connected dashboards and update the Zustand store. The dashboard should display connected agents in real-time, allow users to select agents, send commands through the WebSocket connection, and stream terminal output back to the UI. This includes wiring up: 1) WebSocket initialization in the dashboard page's useEffect, 2) Agent status message handling to update the agent store, 3) Command submission flow from UI through backend to agents, 4) Terminal output streaming from agents back to the dashboard, and 5) Broadcasting agent connection/disconnection events to all dashboard clients. The WebSocket service and stores already exist but need to be connected and made functional."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system operator, I need to monitor and control multiple AI coding agents from a single dashboard in real-time. When I open the dashboard, I should immediately see which agents are online and available. I can select any connected agent and send commands to it, seeing the terminal output stream back to my screen as the command executes. When agents come online or go offline, my dashboard updates automatically without requiring a page refresh.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the dashboard is open, **When** an agent connects to the backend, **Then** the agent appears in the dashboard's agent list within 1 second
2. **Given** an agent is connected and selected, **When** the user sends a command, **Then** the command executes on the agent and terminal output streams back in real-time
3. **Given** multiple dashboards are open, **When** an agent status changes, **Then** all dashboards receive the update simultaneously
4. **Given** a command is executing on an agent, **When** terminal output is generated, **Then** the output appears in the dashboard terminal view character-by-character
5. **Given** an agent is connected, **When** the agent disconnects unexpectedly, **Then** the dashboard shows the agent as offline within 5 seconds

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the dashboard loses connection to the backend temporarily?
- How does system handle simultaneous commands sent to the same agent from different dashboard instances?
- What happens if an agent disconnects while a command is executing?
- How does the system handle very large terminal output streams that might overwhelm the UI?
- What happens when dashboard connections exceed 50 concurrent connections?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all connected agents in real-time on the dashboard
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select any connected agent from the dashboard
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to send commands to selected agents through the dashboard
- **FR-004**: System MUST stream terminal output from agents back to the dashboard in real-time
- **FR-005**: System MUST broadcast agent connection events to all connected dashboards
- **FR-006**: System MUST broadcast agent disconnection events to all connected dashboards
- **FR-007**: Dashboard MUST automatically connect to the backend when opened
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain persistent connection between dashboard and backend
- **FR-009**: System MUST update agent status in the UI state when status messages are received
- **FR-010**: System MUST support multiple dashboard clients monitoring the same agents simultaneously
- **FR-011**: Terminal output MUST preserve formatting and color codes when displayed in dashboard
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle reconnection with exponential backoff (immediate, 1s, 2s, 4s, then cap at 30s intervals)
- **FR-013**: System MUST support up to 10 concurrent agents
- **FR-014**: Dashboard MUST indicate command execution status (queued, running, completed, failed, interrupted)
- **FR-015**: System MUST queue commands per agent with priority levels (high/normal/low) and allow interruption of running commands

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent**: Represents a connected AI coding agent with status (online/offline), identifier, and capabilities
- **Command**: User-initiated instruction sent to an agent with execution status and associated terminal output
- **Dashboard Connection**: Active connection from a dashboard client to the backend, receiving real-time updates
- **Terminal Output**: Stream of text data from agent command execution, including formatting and progress information
- **Agent Status Update**: Real-time notification of agent state changes broadcast to all dashboards
