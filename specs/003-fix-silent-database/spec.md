# Feature Specification: Fix Silent Database Connection Failures

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-silent-database`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix Silent Database Connection Failures (ONS-2) - The backend currently fails silently when Supabase is not configured, creating mock services that don't persist any data. We need to implement proper error handling and a local PostgreSQL fallback for development."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer setting up the Onsembl backend, I need clear feedback when database configuration is missing or incorrect, and I need the system to automatically use a local database for development when cloud services are not configured, so that I can develop and test features without requiring production credentials.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer starts the backend without database credentials, **When** the system initializes, **Then** a clear error message appears indicating which configuration is missing
2. **Given** a developer starts the backend without cloud database credentials, **When** a local database is available, **Then** the system automatically connects to the local database and displays a message indicating local mode
3. **Given** the backend is running with a database connection, **When** a database operation is performed (save agent, log command, etc.), **Then** the data persists and can be retrieved after restart
4. **Given** the backend loses database connection during operation, **When** a database operation is attempted, **Then** a clear error is returned to the user indicating the connection issue
5. **Given** a developer runs the backend in development mode, **When** checking system logs, **Then** the active database mode (cloud/local/mock) is clearly displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when both cloud and local databases are unavailable?
- How does system handle database connection timeout during startup?
- What happens when database connection is lost mid-operation?
- How does system handle switching between database modes without data loss?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate database configuration on startup and report missing or invalid settings
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide clear, actionable error messages when database operations fail
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically detect and use local database when cloud credentials are absent
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist all data operations (agents, commands, terminal output, audit logs) across restarts
- **FR-005**: System MUST log the active database mode (cloud/local/mock) at startup
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform health checks on database connection before accepting operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent silent failures by ensuring all database operations either succeed or return explicit errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain the same data schema across all database modes (cloud/local)
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide a way to initialize local database with required schema
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle database connection failures gracefully without crashing

### Key Entities
- **Database Configuration**: Settings that determine which database to connect to (cloud credentials, local connection string)
- **Database Connection**: Active connection to either cloud or local database that handles all persistence operations
- **Service Operations**: Business logic operations that require database persistence (agent registration, command logging, etc.)
- **Connection Health Status**: Current state of database connectivity and operational readiness
