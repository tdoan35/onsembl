# Feature Specification: Fix Silent Database Connection Failures

**Feature Branch**: `003-fix-silent-database`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Fix Silent Database Connection Failures (ONS-2) - The backend currently fails silently when Supabase is not configured, creating mock services that don't persist any data. We need to implement proper error handling and a local PostgreSQL fallback for development."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a developer setting up the Onsembl backend, I need clear feedback when Supabase is not configured or running, and I need simple instructions to start local Supabase for development, so that I can develop and test features with the same stack as production without requiring cloud credentials.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer starts the backend without Supabase configuration, **When** the system initializes, **Then** a clear error message appears with instructions to either set environment variables or run `supabase start`
2. **Given** a developer starts the backend with local Supabase running, **When** the system initializes, **Then** it automatically connects to local Supabase and displays "Connected to local Supabase at localhost:54321"
3. **Given** the backend is running with Supabase connection, **When** a database operation is performed (save agent, log command, etc.), **Then** the data persists and can be retrieved after restart
4. **Given** the backend loses Supabase connection during operation, **When** a database operation is attempted, **Then** a clear error is returned indicating the connection issue with recovery suggestions
5. **Given** a developer runs the backend, **When** checking system logs, **Then** the Supabase environment (local/cloud) and connection status are clearly displayed

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Supabase is not configured and not running locally?
- How does system handle Supabase connection timeout during startup?
- What happens when Supabase connection is lost mid-operation?
- How does system detect and differentiate between local and cloud Supabase?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST validate Supabase configuration on startup and report if neither environment variables nor local Supabase is available
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide clear, actionable error messages including "Run `supabase start` for local development" when Supabase is not configured
- **FR-003**: System MUST automatically detect and connect to local Supabase (localhost:54321) when cloud credentials are absent
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist all data operations (agents, commands, terminal output, audit logs) across restarts
- **FR-005**: System MUST log whether connected to local or cloud Supabase at startup
- **FR-006**: System MUST perform health checks on Supabase connection before accepting operations
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent silent failures by ensuring all database operations either succeed or return explicit errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST use the same Supabase client and schema for both local and cloud environments
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide clear setup instructions for local Supabase including migration commands
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle Supabase connection failures gracefully without crashing

### Key Entities
- **Supabase Configuration**: Environment variables (SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY) that determine which Supabase instance to connect to
- **Supabase Connection**: Active Supabase client connection that handles all persistence operations
- **Service Operations**: Business logic operations that require database persistence (agent registration, command logging, etc.)
- **Connection Health Status**: Current state of Supabase connectivity and operational readiness
